All Rights Reserved.

These programs are licensed under the BSD license (the one with

If you are submitting changes to the project, please see CONTRIBUTIONS
file for more instructions.


This package may include either wpa_supplicant, hostapd, or both. See
README file respective subdirectories (wpa_supplicant/README or
hostapd/README) for more details.

Source code files were moved around in v0.6.x releases and compared to
earlier releases, the programs are now built by first going to a
subdirectory (wpa_supplicant or hostapd) and creating build
configuration (.config) and running 'make' there (for Linux/BSD/cygwin
builds).
