DiVine - DirectFB Virtual Input extension
-----------------------------------------

DiVine consists of
- an input driver that reads raw input events from a pipe
  and dispatches them via a virtual input device.
- a library that handles the connection to the input driver
  including helper functions for generating events.
- a tool called "spooky" to generate input events using a
  simple script featuring button or motion events, linear
  or circular automated motion and delays.
